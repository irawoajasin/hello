                    <h3>2021</h3>
                    <p>i supported a team of educators to develop and facilitate an anti-oppressive game design curriculum for a group of 8 high schoolers of color. the goal of <a href="https://husain-rizvi.wixsite.com/gamesforjustice">the program</a> was building a collective for underrepresented youth game designers to use the creative medium of games to explore themes of economic democracy, collective care, and anti-capitalism.</p>
